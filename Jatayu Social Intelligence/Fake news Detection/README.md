Within the JATAYU intelligence sub system we have a fake news detection model which works on the extracted informations by JATAYU scrapes and classifies the news collected as real or fake news.

Further over time we will also add models to detect hate speeches as well as we can also monitor the post rates and present graphically about the quality of posts written
