# Jatayu Accident Detector


#Introduction

We created a accident detector using a deep learning model which with limited data we achieved an accuracy of 89.98%. Of course the accuracy will even increase more when it will be trained with more data as we go on to deploy it. We are integrating it with a automatic system which will automatically send the information about the accident to the authorities with the GPS location of the camera which has recorded the accident.
  
This piece of technology will be specially important and implementable with already existing hardware for the accident prone areas. A lot of life can be saved by this tech.
